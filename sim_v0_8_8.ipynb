And it is true!! In Federated Learning, the way clients perform local training makes use of the same principles as more traditional centralised setup. The key difference is that the dataset now is much smaller and it's never _\"seen\"_ by the entity running the FL workload (i.e. the central server).\n",

It is involved in all stages of a FL pipeline: sampling clients; sending the _global model_ to the clients so they can do `fit()`; receive the updated models from the clients and **aggregate** these to construct a new _global model_; define and execute global or federated evaluation; and more.\n",

        "\n",
        "The way `FedAvg` works is simple but performs surprisingly well in practice. It is therefore one good strategy to start your experimentation. `FedAvg`, as its name implies, derives a new version of the _global model_ by taking the average of all the models sent by clients participating in the round. You can read all the details [in the paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.05629).\n",
        "\n",
        "Let's see how we can define `FedAvg` using Flower. We use one of the callbacks called `evaluate_fn` so we can easily evaluate the state of the global model using a small centralised testset. Note this functionality is user-defined since it requires a choice in terms of ML-framework. (if you recall, Flower is framework agnostic).\n",
        "\n",
        "> This being said, centralised evaluation of the global model is only possible if there exists a centralised dataset that somewhat follows a similar distribution as the data that's spread across clients. In some cases having such centralised dataset for validation is not possible, so the only solution is to federate the evaluation of the _global model_. This is the default behaviour in Flower. If you don't specify teh `evaluate_fn` argument in your strategy, then, centralised global evaluation won't be performed."
